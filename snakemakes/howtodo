Here's how the jarvis_snakemake.yaml file was made, and how it can be used:
I took a yaml file from jarvis
conda env export > jarvis_snakemake.yaml
and then made it my own (but changed the name)
conda env create --name jarvis_snakemake --file jarvis_snakemake.yaml
(I tried a few versions of the above, btw, before it worked. hopefully the errors in the process didn't build towards a solution that worked... ie, it's possible that that 1-liner might not fly)
